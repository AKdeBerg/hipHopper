## Tech I Used
This app is purely made with vanilla JavaScript & raw HTML/CSS. It is to demonstrate, if you can be creative you can make something amazing out of those core technologies.

Key topics-
+ **HTML:** I used custom data- attribute & audio tag
+ **CSS:** I used Flexbox to position the image, transition to the effects key button. And color contrast is tested by various plugins
+ **JS:** I used DOM manipulation technique to co-ordinate transition and classes. Events that I used are mainly keydown and transitionend
